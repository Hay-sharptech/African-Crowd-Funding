# African-Crowd-Funding
With COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacting, exposing, and dismantling the emerging economic stability and services in Africa, a greater drive for the adoption and adaptation of blockchain technologies cannot be overemphasised. With the exponential growth blockchain ecosystem has to offer Africa, a great need as arisen for Africa to have an indegenous Initial Dex Offering (IDO) platform focusing on Africa blockchain founders battling with the defiance of visibility and funding.
This is primarily focused to entirely shine the spotlight on Africa associating projects without leaving out other continents of the world.   
Creating a DAO platform that spotlight African based blockchain startups projects.
